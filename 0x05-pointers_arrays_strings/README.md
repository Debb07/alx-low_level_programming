This project covers C pointers, arrays and strings.
C pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are very useful for data value manipulation and in memory layout.
C arrays are a set of fixed-size sequential data of the same data type. They are useful for assigning strings and large data to variables. They are a form of Data Structure.
C strings are a set of characters (alphabets) that can be printed out as the stdout of a program.
